# ESLint Cheatsheet

ESLint is undeniably great, but can be a bit of a pain in the &#!% to trawl through when deciding on a style guideline for your next project. In particular, one has to visit each page individually to view example snippets, and there is no succint way of seeing which rules are enabled by default without viewing the `eslint.json` config file outright.

This repo aims to be a down-and-dirty ESLint cheatsheet, up-to-date as of 2015-08-19. Click on the following links to view compiled Markdown tables of the documentation for each section, or all rules enabled by default in ESLint.
